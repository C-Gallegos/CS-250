# CS-250
I interpret the user's wants by listening to them, breaking them down into tasks that my team can understand. Creating user stories helps this by putting yourself in the mindset of the end user and letting the programmer know what the user wants to do. This gives the programmer a better visual of what the end product needs to accomplish. I approach developing programs by breaking the program into bite-sized problems and taking the program one step at a time. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my programming are creating a  product backlog board, that way it gives me a visual of what I accomplished, what I need to accomplish, and what I'm working on. To be a good team member in software development, you have to have good communication skills. You have to be able to communicate what you are working on, what's troubling you in your project, as well as being able to communicate if you need help.
